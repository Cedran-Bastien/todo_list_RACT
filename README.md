# Todo-List

the goal of this project is to create a web app to organise us more easly in a team... with centered data.

Actually, You can create an account and sign in with it. You can then use the todo list. But there's only one list for all user

The next step of the app is to have one todo list by User and that can be shared to other User by inviting them in a team.

After that, I want to add an other part to the app to use it like a AGILE did-todo-done in a team

For me it's an opportinity to increase my level of REACT and of its environment.
